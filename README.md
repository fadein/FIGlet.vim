Use the g@ operator or the :FIGlet command to filter your text through figlet, in-place! 
:FIGlet has a completion function that will complete on installed font names, too. 

Plus, there is a Windows/MS-DOS version of FIGlet, so everybody can get in on the fun! 

Q: Can't I do this same thing with the :! command?

A: Basically, sure 

Q: What does this plugin give me that Vim's built-in filtering doesn't?

A1. Convenience - through variables it can remember your preferences

A2. Completion - so you don't have to memorize all of the commands or font names

A3. Text-objects - use the g@ operator with text-objects for blazing fast transformations that will knock shoulder-surfer's socks off

A4. A font sample buffer to help you pick out the perfect font for the occasion


Q: Okay, I'm sold.  But what is this FIGlet you speak of? 

A: This:

```
  __ _       _      _   
/ _(_) __ _| | ___| |_ 
| |_| |/ _` | |/ _ \ __| 
|  _| | (_| | |  __/ |_ 
|_| |_|\__, |_|\___|\__| 
	   |___/             
```
